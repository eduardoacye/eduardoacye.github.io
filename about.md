# About the blog
This is my personal blog, i'll try to post about the things i'm interested in, such as programming, computer science and math.

I'll try to show some of my personal little uncreative and unoriginal programs, as well as rants about the people in my life and school environment.

# About the dude

My name is Eduardo Acuña Yeomans and i'm 21 years old. I live in Hermosillo, Sonora, México and study Computer Science at the Universidad de Sonora.

Maybe i'll change my name in a few years, move out of this place and stop studying Computer Science to make the previous description obsolete.

# Proyects i'm working on

- [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) exercises
- Graph Algorithms, Finite State Machines and Cellular Automata applications for experimenting with algorithms (GrafoVis, Automatón, CellularAutomatón)
- Cactus (Scheme Preprocessor for outputing PDFs)
- MacanOS Scheme (very early stage of development, Scheme VM + Scheme Kernel + R7RS + Process Scheduler + File System)
