This is the first blog post of my site.

I'm trying to understand the use of Jekyll to make static blogs so i'm struggling with techincal problems for the moment.

# Testing some shit

This is some math bullshit:

$$f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x^{2^{3}}$$

This is some code bullshit:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (map proc lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car lst)) (map proc (cdr lst)))))
{% endhighlight %}

This is some gist repository bullshit:

{% gist eduardoacye/d28e2e8f4305b30136fc %}

# The blog

In the following weeks i'll be adding some posts under these categories:

- Hack-a-palooza
- Hackernation
- Personal programming projects
- Thesis updates

# Colophon

Shout-out to all my peeps, in particular to [Daniel Contreras](http://dancmj.github.io/)
